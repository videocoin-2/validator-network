## **1. Introduction**

### **Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive technical specification for the Validator Network responsible for managing and operating the Videocoin protocol contracts on an EVM-compatible blockchain. This network ensures the integrity, security, and proper functioning of the protocol by validating proofs and generating necessary transactions.

### **Scope**

This yellow paper covers the architecture, design principles, protocols, security measures, and operational guidelines for the Validator Network. It is intended for developers, validators, and stakeholders involved in the implementation and maintenance of the network.

---

## **2. System Overview**

### **Architecture**

The Validator Network is a permissioned blockchain built using the Polkadot Substrate framework. It operates in conjunction with the EVM-compatible chain where the Videocoin protocol contracts are deployed. The validators are trusted entities who:

- Validate proofs submitted to the protocol contracts.
- Generate and sign transactions required for protocol operations.
- Manage and own the protocol contracts collectively.

### **Components**

- **Validator Nodes**: Run the Substrate-based blockchain and participate in consensus.
- **EVM-Compatible Chain**: Hosts the Videocoin protocol smart contracts.
- **Videocoin Protocol Contracts**: Smart contracts including `StakingManager.sol`, `StreamManager.sol`, `Stream.sol`, and `Escrow.sol`.
- **Message Relaying Mechanism**: Facilitates communication between the Validator Network and the EVM chain.

---

## **3. Validator Network Design**

### **Permissioned Network**

The network is permissioned, meaning only authorized validators can join and participate. Validators are selected based on their credibility and trustworthiness. There are no tokens involved in operating the network; validators' incentives are aligned through their reputation and commitment to the protocol's success.

### **Validator Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Proof Validation**: Validate proofs submitted to the Videocoin protocol contracts.
- **Transaction Generation**: Create and sign transactions to update protocol states.
- **Contract Management**: Own and manage protocol contracts on the EVM chain.
- **Event Monitoring**: Listen for events emitted by the protocol contracts that require validator action.

### **Consensus Mechanism**

- **Proof of Authority (PoA)**: A consensus algorithm suitable for permissioned networks with trusted validators.
  - **Validators**: Predefined and authorized entities.
  - **Block Production**: Validators take turns producing blocks in a round-robin fashion.
  - **Finality**: Achieved quickly due to the trusted nature of validators.

---

## **4. Interaction with EVM-Compatible Chain**

### **Message Relaying Mechanism**

A simple message relaying mechanism is used for communication between the Validator Network and the EVM chain.

- **Event Monitoring**: Validators use APIs (e.g., JSON-RPC) to monitor events from the EVM chain.
- **Direct Interaction**: Validators interact directly with the EVM chain by submitting signed transactions.
- **No Bridge Required**: Due to the trusted environment, a full bridge implementation is unnecessary.

### **Smart Contract Modifications**

Modifications are made to the Videocoin protocol contracts to support validator operations:

- **Access Control**: Contracts include mechanisms to restrict function calls to authorized validator addresses.
- **Event Emission**: Contracts emit events to signal when validator action is required.
- **Function Interfaces**: Additional functions may be added to facilitate validator interactions.

---

## **5. Validation and Transaction Workflow**

### **Proof Validation Process**

1. **Event Detection**: Validators detect events on the EVM chain indicating new proofs or actions needed.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Relevant data is fetched from the EVM chain for validation.
3. **Validation Logic**: Validators perform validation according to the protocol's rules.
4. **Consensus (if necessary)**: In most cases, validators can act independently due to the trusted setup.
5. **Action Determination**: Decide whether to accept or reject the proof.

### **Transaction Generation and Signing**

1. **Transaction Creation**: Based on the validation result, a transaction is created to update the protocol contract.
2. **Signing**: The transaction is signed using the validator's private key.
3. **Submission**: The signed transaction is submitted to the EVM chain for execution.

---

## **6. Security and Integrity Measures**

### **Access Control**

- **Authorized Addresses**: The protocol contracts maintain a list of authorized validator addresses.
- **Function Restrictions**: Critical functions can only be called by these authorized addresses.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The list of authorized validators can be updated as needed.

### **Authentication and Authorization**

- **Digital Signatures**: Validators sign transactions with their private keys to authenticate their identity.
- **Transaction Verification**: The EVM chain verifies the signature before accepting the transaction.
- **Replay Protection**: Nonces or similar mechanisms are used to prevent replay attacks.

---

## **7. Governance and Validator Management**

### **Validator Selection and Onboarding**

- **Criteria**: Validators are selected based on credibility, expertise, and alignment with the protocol's goals.
- **Onboarding Process**:
  - **Verification**: Validators undergo a verification process.
  - **Agreement**: Validators agree to terms and conditions outlining their responsibilities.
  - **Configuration**: Validators are provided with the necessary configuration to join the network.

### **Accountability and Compliance**

- **Reputation at Stake**: Validators risk reputational damage if they act maliciously.
- **Removal Mechanisms**: Validators can be removed from the network for misconduct.
- **Compliance**: Validators must adhere to operational guidelines and legal requirements.

---

## **8. Technical Specifications**

### **Substrate Configuration**

- **Consensus Algorithm**: Proof of Authority (PoA) using Aura.
- **Runtime Modules (Pallets)**:
  - **Timestamp**: Handles block timestamps.
  - **Aura**: Manages block authorship in PoA.
  - **Grandpa**: Finality gadget for block finalization.
  - **Custom Pallets**: For governance and validator management as needed.

### **Network Parameters**

- **Block Time**: Configurable (e.g., 6 seconds).
- **Validator Set Size**: Determined by the number of trusted validators (e.g., 5-15).
- **Transaction Throughput**: Sufficient for the expected load, optimized as needed.

---

## **9. Operational Considerations**

### **Deployment and Maintenance**

- **Initial Deployment**:
  - Validators set up nodes according to provided configurations.
  - Genesis block includes initial validator set.
- **Software Updates**:
  - Coordinated updates to the validator software and protocol contracts.
  - Validators must keep their nodes up to date.

### **Monitoring and Logging**

  - Overall network health is monitored, including block production and finalization.
- **Logging**:
  - Detailed logs are maintained for auditing and troubleshooting.

---

## **10. Security Considerations**

### **Threat Model**

- **Internal Threats**:
  - Malicious actions by validators (unlikely due to trust model).
- **External Threats**:
  - Attacks on validator nodes (DDoS, intrusion).
  - Attacks on the protocol contracts (exploiting vulnerabilities).

### **Mitigation Strategies**

- **Validator Security**:
  - Validators secure their nodes with best practices (firewalls, secure keys).
- **Network Security**:
  - Use of secure communication protocols.
- **Contract Security**:
  - Thorough audits of the protocol contracts.
  - Implementation of security best practices in smart contract development.
